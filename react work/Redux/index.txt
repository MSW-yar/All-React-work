redux basicaluy stores a data in middle so every compo can acess to it.
we have to import the redux library by the link.
 than we have to make an object with that redux init e.g :
    const { createStore } = redux
  than we have to make the function that is going to link the data storage and the reducer
  isi liye hamein storage k func ko banane k liye parameter paas krna ho reducer ka that is also the function.
        e.g const mystate = createStore(myreducer)
than function myreducer (state, action){

}

mgr my reducer ko initial state chahiye hogi jo hm dein ge.

const initState = {
  todos : [],
  posts : []

}

hence ,myreducer (state = initState, action)

state chanage krne k liye hamein pehle dispatch action use krna hai jo reduce kre ga

const todoAction = {
  type:'ADD_TODO',
  todo: 'buy milk'
}
